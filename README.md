# Recruitment-project

The present project aimed to contribute to the improvement of the recruitment and selection process of an enterprise. The dataset used contains 1000 applicants for positions in one company. 3 different ML models were trained to predict if each particular candidate is likely to be hired or not. Those models were: Neural Network with two hidden layers and drop-out, Naive Bayes classifier, and decision tree. 

The first two used combinations of different indicators features, while the 3rd model (decision tree) used descriptive features of the data set (like age, gender, and nationality). To use those descriptors in the HR process is unethical, thus it was interesting only in theory if it would make a better performing model. 

In this repository you may find another readme file containing Data Exploration process of the used dataset. The dataset itself, and the code for 3 models.
